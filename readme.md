# Objective

The objective of this project is to create a go script that will fetch the latest image of the day from the NASA image of the day website.

Later, I will add the functionality to download the image and set it as the wallpaper automatically.

# Usage

To use this script, you will need to have go installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

Once you have go installed, you can run the following command to get the image of the day:

```bash
go run main.go
```

# How it works

# Output
